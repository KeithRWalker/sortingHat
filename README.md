# Sorting Hat

## Description
* ## Overview 
    * In this assignment I was given the task of making a way to accept user input, and using that input to make a bootstrap card. I was also tasked with providing a button to delete a card after it had been printed to the DOM. This was supposed to represent the "Sorting Hat" from Harry Potter so I also needed to assign a random house to each user inputted name/card. I decided to add images, and some facts for each house to an array, and used that information to add to the cards.
